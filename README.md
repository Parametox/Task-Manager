# Task-Manager
This is task manager. You can show all saved tasks and add a new one. Additionaly you can delete a task if you want to. I made it to show you that I know how to use a fundamental principles in OOP. I would like to show you how I had used FIleStream class to read data to login into database with tasks. After getting data from data.txt application connects with database using created own there own connection string. I used few T-SQL queries to get, delete and insert data in database.

Aplication consist of three parts: (description what include inside)
1. Model-> logic of application, read from file, connection to base, menu's methods;
2. View-> methods made to presents a values;
3. Controller-> getting data from User.

Application shows using mainly SOLID and MVC principles.
